            All praise and glory be to God Almighty, to whom we belong, for
            granting us the privilege of working alongside Him in reaching out
            to souls. May the fruits of our labor be His alone, forever. Amen.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are a group of believers from various denominations, united by a
            passion for missions. Our sole aim is to reach out to souls wherever
            they may be, enabling their salvation, rededication, commitment, and
            discipleship, transforming them into effective tools in God's hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            To achieve this, we prayerfully seek and visit a mission field each
            Christmas period. The local mission agency or umbrella organization
            serves as our host. Since 2012, we have been privileged to visit
            several mission fields across various states in Nigeria. However,
            our initial mission efforts, born out of a strong passion for
            soul-winning, began at Kagoro Mountains in 2007.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, we rely on God's provision and leverage our individual
            commitments, as well as the support of like-minded individuals,
            groups, and organizations to fund our missions. We present the
            Gospel message in accordance with the Bible and entrust new converts
            to the care of local missionaries and pastors for follow-up and
            discipleship.
