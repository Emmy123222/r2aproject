        We are a group of believers from diverse denominations, united by a
        passion for missions. We aim to reach out to people everywhere, enabling
        their salvation, rededication, commitment, and discipleship, so that
        they may become effective tools in God's hands. We achieve this by
        prayerfully seeking and visiting mission fields, and partnering with
        local churches and agencies. We present the Gospel message in accordance
        with the Bible and entrust new converts to the care of local
        missionaries and pastors for follow-up and discipleship.
